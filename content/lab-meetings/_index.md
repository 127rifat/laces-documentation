## Outline for Paper Review Talks
Structure for paper review (rough outline don’t take slide counts too literally):
1. Title of paper, authors, date, journal
2. 2 slides on background, context, what’s identified as open problems
3. 1-3 slides on methods (this will depend on complexity)
4. 0.5-1 slide for each of the major figures in paper, typically between 8-12
5. Discussion/conclusions: What points are the authors making with their paper. Do you agree? Do you think that the results that are presented justify the conclusions?
Terminology: Any new words, or concepts that we should add to our lab documentation
